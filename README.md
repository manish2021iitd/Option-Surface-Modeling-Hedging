# Option-Surface Modeling & Hedging (Neural IV Surface + Delta-Hedge Simulator)
 Build a neural model that learns and forecasts the implied-volatility surface, calibrates to market prices, and evaluates delta-hedging performance on a simulated/real options dataset.

## Goals
* Learn/improve the implied-volatility surface model (interpolate + forecast).

* Price options and simulate delta-hedging P&L using forecasted surfaces.

* Compare classical parameterizations (SVI/Heston) vs ML models (NN) for pricing and hedging.

## Data
* Historical option chains for SPX / AAPL / BTC options. (Use publicly available datasets on Kaggle, or collect via brokers/APIs — if restricted, simulate via Heston model to create realistic training data.)

* Underlying price history and interest/dividend data.

## Methods / Models
* Baselines: SVI parameterization, Black-Scholes, Heston calibration.

* ML model: feedforward Net or small encoder (MSE loss on implied volatility or log-price), optionally use temporal model (LSTM/Transformer) to forecast next-day IV surface.

* Regularization: arbitrage constraints (monotonicity in strike, calendar arbitrage), add penalty terms or enforce via architecture.

* Hedging simulator: delta-hedge using discrete rebalancing, transaction costs, evaluate hedging P&L.

## Implementation plan
* Data & features: build normalized inputs (moneyness K/S, time-to-maturity τ, option type).

* Baseline SVI: implement SVI calibration and use as benchmark.

* Neural model: design network to map (moneyness, τ, timestamp) → implied vol; train on historical surface.

* Forecasting: train temporal model to predict next-day surface.

* Pricing & hedging: price options from predicted IV, run delta-hedge simulation on test period.

* Metrics & stress tests: MAPE/MSE on IV, pricing RMSE, hedging P&L mean/std, worst-case loss.

* Notebook & dashboard: interactive UI showing surfaces, calibration errors, hedging P&L.

* Packaging: Docker, README, reproducible scripts.

## Tech stack
* Python, pandas, NumPy, PyTorch/TensorFlow, scikit-learn

* QuantLib or py_vollib for pricing/Greeks

* Visualization: Streamlit/Plotly

* Optional: MLFlow for experiments

## Evaluation / metrics to show on resume
* IV surface MSE and pricing RMSE vs SVI baseline (e.g., “reduced pricing RMSE by 18% vs SVI”).

* Delta-hedge P&L statistics: mean P&L, P&L volatility, hit rate of hedging.

Arbitrage violations count (show how ML model enforces fewer).
